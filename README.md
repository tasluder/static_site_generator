# static_site_generator
This project has a really cool premise: take a .md file and turn it into a static website automatically. However, the learning curve has been steep on this one! There is a cool axiom that a problem written down is a problem halved - thanks Kidlin - so I want to do some of my own documentation to make sure I know where my roadblocks are and work through them.

This will be broken down into the different segments that match what boot.dev has outlined - I'm not just copying and pasting what the websites say - I want to learn a bit more, so I'll be trying to put it in my own words.

## Chapter 1: Static Sites
### mod1: Build a Static Site Generator
This module explains what static sites do, and it only asks us to echo "bootdev cli is ready!"

Done.

### mod2: HTML
This module has us set up an HTML file and goes over some of the basics of HTML. I did a lot of frontend training... I agree... it's not for me. 

It also has us set up a new dir and use Python's built in [HTTP server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) to serve the contents of that directory. Cool!

Done.

### mod3: CSS
HTML makes sense to me... the tags the links... almost all of it. CSS? No. I hate it! I think the reason is because I'm not necessarily a super creative type in this fashion, so it's a struggle to make something pretty when it's so complicated to get there. I would much rather just have a basic website and *good* functionality instead of decent functionality and a pretty website.

We linked the CSS file we created to the HTML file and gave ourselves a basic design to our website.

Done.

### mod4: Markdown
A quick review of Markdown - I love it. Just a simple question to answer and we move on.

### mod5: Cheat Sheet
This goes over some of the basic formatting for both HTML and MD - a few good resources are given [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and [html element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

A quick question to answer and we're off. Done.

### mod6: Cheat Sheet
Another quick question to answer and we're done. Boom.

## Chapter 2: Nodes
This chapter has us dig in a bit more in some different ways.

### mod1: TextNode
This TextNode class that we're creating will serve as the in-between -- it's the plain text version of either the Markdown input or the HTML output (does this mean we could also go in reverse? maybe, right? Could I take an HTML file and turn it into a Markdown file? I would assume so, but that's getting carried away -- I'll start a to-do section and toss this down there).
